			<h2> TI-73 Series </h2>
			<p> 
				The TI-73 is a series of calculators based on the <a href="83.html">TI-83 series,</a> except cut down in software and price to fixate on a middle-school market. First in 1998, the original TI-73 was released as a replacement for the TI-80. It brings features much more in-line with TI-83 Plus recently released, to the point where the specs are identical to an 83 Plus. The OS was the main differentiator, both removing some features TI deemed unnecessary at the middle school level, but also adding data visualization features, like pie charts. In 2008, a program called Chameleon released which allowed the 83 Plus OS to be flashed onto the 73, giving it the full functionality it's capable of.<br><br>
				In 2003, the TI-73 was redesigned under the "Explorer" brand, and positioned as a gateway between the TI-15 Explorer for elementary schools, and the TI-83 and 84 series. In 2009, it was redesigned once more to have a shell identical to the 84 Plus, just painted blue. Both of the explorer models are common to find and still supported today. There is no hardware difference between any of the TI-73 models.
