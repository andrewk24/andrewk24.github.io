			<h2> TI-Nspire (2007-2010 models) </h2>
			<p> The initial rollout of TI-Nspire was an interesting one.<br><br>
			    First, in 2007, two models were released, the TI-Nspire and TI-Nspire CAS. These are now known as TI-Nspire with Clickpad to differentiate it from future models.<br><br>
				In 2010, the TI-Nspire with Touchpad as well as TI-Nspire CAS with touchpad were released, and came in a new black color, as well as the namesake input method. The 2007 TI-Nspire with Clickpad, and only that model, could be upgraded to have the new touchpad as well.<br> <br>
				Additionally, there was a TI-84 Plus Keypad for the non-CAS models that would allow you to emulate a TI-84 Plus Silver Edition.<br><br>
				Not at all confusing, right? Thankfully, all the models share the same specifications as seen on the right of this page. They can also be jailbroken the same way, with Ndless.<br><br>
