			<h2> The Texas Instruments Z80 Series </h2>
			
			<p>
				TI's "Z80 Series" includes graphing calculators with the Zilog Z80 and the similar Zilog eZ80 microprocessor. <br> Please note this is an unofficial naming scheme created by the TI fan community. <br> The calculators with regular Z80s include:
				<ul>
					<li>TI-73, 73-Explorer</li>
					<li>TI-81</li>
					<li>TI-82</li>
					<li><a href="83/index.html">TI-83, 83 Plus, 83 Plus Silver Edition</a></li>
					<li>TI-84 Plus, 84 Plus Silver Edition, 84 Plus C Silver Edition</li>
					<li>TI-85</li>
					<li>TI-86</li>
				</ul>
				While the newer calculators with eZ80 chips include:
				<ul>
					<li>TI-84 Plus CE / 83 Premium CE</li>
				</ul>
				It's worth noting the TI-80 has a very similar UI to the Z80 models, and is often grouped in with them as such. However, it instead has a Toshiba T6M53 ASIC and is not compatible with other models outside of TI-BASIC.<br>
				<br>
				These calculators are usually TI's most popular, one reason being their standard user inferface established in 1990. <br>
				Due to this lack of change for the past few decades, models as old as the TI-83 Plus from 1999 are still being sold and used to this day.<br><br>
				They also have a plethora of programming tools and tutorials, some official, most not. You can learn more about your model's capabilities by visiting its specific page.
