			<h2> TI-82 </h2>
			<p> 
				After the engineering focused <a href="85.html">TI-85,</a> TI went back to basics with the replacement for the TI-81 in 1993. It features specifications more in line with later models, introducing a new SoC allowing the calculator to reach a 6MHz clock speed. The RAM was also dramatically increased to make room for the most useful addition: the link port. Allowing users to transfer programs and variables to other calculators or from a computer. This, along with the TI-85 before it, started a newfound wave of programmers making games and other tools for these calculators via exploits that allowed machine code to run. <br><br>
				There were three other models of TI-82. In 1999, the 82 was refreshed with the same casing style as the recently released TI-83. It was also given a price-cut so as to not compete with it. In 2000, the case was changed again for the TI-82 "Parcus", which was given a further price cut. And finally, the TI-82 line was finished in 2004 with the TI-82 Stats- a blue TI-82 Parcus with an OS upgrade, giving it very similar functionality to the TI-83. This model was first introduced only in France, but was later sold to other European countries.<br><br>
