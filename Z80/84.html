			<h2> TI-84 Series </h2>
			<p> The TI-84 Plus series is the most popular of calculators that Texas Instruments sells. Originally released in 2004 as a follow-up to the TI-83 Plus, it introduced MathPrint, a staple feature of even lower end TIs today, as well as 2.5x the performance of the 83 Plus before it. Confusingly, there is no TI-84 non-plus model.<br> <br>
				Also in 2004, the TI-84 Plus Silver Editionwas introduced, giving 1.5MB of Flash and a new case that comes in a variety of colors. <br> <br>
				Finally, in 2013, the TI-84 Plus C Silver Edition was released, where the C stands for Color. The notable improvements were a 320x240 colored and backlit screen, a rechargable Li-Ion battery, and an increase to 3.5MB of flash. <br><br>
				Sadly, the CPU was the same as the previous 84 models, but had to run a much higher resolution screen. As a result, the calculator was infamously unresponsive, and much slower at graphing than it's predecessors. It has since been replaced by the TI-84 Plus CE.
