			<h2> The TI-92 series and Voyage 200</h2>
				<p> The TI-92 series is most well known for its Computer Algebra System, or CAS, which allows it to handle symbolic representation. It has been notoriously labelled as a "computer" by many American testing boards, and can't be used on standardized tests. The 92s specifically are also notable for being user-upgradable with more memory and Flash ROM, and being the first of TI's to support 3D graphing. </p>
				<h3> Hardware Revisions </h3>
				<p> In 1995, the original TI-92 released. This would be the base model that future 68k's would expand on, in two forms- modules, and seperate units.<br><br>
				This would first be seen with the TI-92 II, in 1996. It increased the memory to 128KB, and added support for 5 new languages - English, French, German, Italian and Spanish. The new OS that contained these languages as well as extra RAM was also available as a module you could insert into your existing TI-92.<br><br>
				In 1998, along with a much improved screen similar to the newly released 83 Plus, the ram was increased again to 188KB, and 720KB of rewritable flash was added, also known as the "archive." Like the 92 II, it was also available as a module which added the extra RAM and flash, along with a new OS to support these additions.<br><br>
				In 2002, the updated Voyage 200 was released, which gave it a well-deserved, thinner redesign, as well as a whopping 2.7MB of flash. This, along with the 89 Titanium, is the only 68k calculator TI still supports.</p>
