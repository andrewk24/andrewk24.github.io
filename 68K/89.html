			<h2> The TI-89 series</h2>
				<p> The TI-89 series is a miniturized version of the TI-92/Voyage 200 series. Like its parent, it is most well known for its Computer Algebra System, or CAS, which allows it to handle symbolic representation.</p>
				<h3> Hardware Revisions </h3>
				<p> In 1998, the original TI-89 released, being a TI-92 Plus in the form factor of a TI-83. It also removed the QWERTY keyboard to both decrease the size and for it to be allowed on the SAT and many other standardized tests. </p>
				<p> In 2004, the updated TI-89 Titanium was released, which, similar to it's predecessor, was a smaller Voyage 200. It featured a new OS revision, a miniUSB port, and a shell very similar to that of the TI-84 Plus. This model is still supported by TI to this day.</p>
				<p> Beyond the differences of the 89 and 89 Titanium, there were 4 hardware versions over the course of the TI-89's life. <p>
				<ul>
					<li>HW1 - The initial release of the TI-89, @10MHz</li>
					<li>HW2 - The initial release of the TI-89, @12MHz</li>
					<li>HW3 - The initial release of the TI-89 Titanium, @12MHz</li>
					<li>HW4 - The latest release of the TI-89 Titanium, @16MHz</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The main difference between HW1 and HW2 is the new VRAM section for faster screen access, but this breaks compatibility with grayscale programs written for HW1, where 7-level grayscale was possible.</p>
				<p>Later hardware revisions also support newer OSes, and larger limits on ASM programs. Early versions of the OS had no limit, and the latest OS has a limit of 64kb.</p>
