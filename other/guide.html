			<h1> The MATHEMADNESS Guide to Choosing a Graphing Calculator <br>(Under construction)</h1>
			<p>
				There's a lot of graphing calculators to choose from today. It may be compelling to pick up a TI-84 Plus and be done with it, but if you're here, you must be interested in exploring other options. We'll be covering all the calculators the 4 major brands still sell and support, for the best longevity.<br><br>
				However, there's a couple questions you should ask yourself before reading on. Firstly, do you even need a graphing calculator?<br><br>
				Scientific and financial calculators have gotten considerably more advanced over the years, and the functionality gap between them with between every new model. So I present to you:<br>
				<h3>A List of Things That Most Scientific Calculators Cannot Do But Most Graphing Ones Can! (or LOTTMSCCDBMGOC for short)</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Graphing (of course)</li>
					<li>Running or creating games or programs</li>
					<li>Solving linear equations larger than degree three</li>
					<li>Transferring memory from one calculator to another</li>
					<li>Have it's OS updated</li>
				</ul>
				That might have been quite a bit less than you were expecting, considering modern graphing calculators are more or less pocket computers, so if you don't need the above features, consider purchasing a TI-36X Pro or Casio FX-991EX. These calculators are very close in terms of UI to their respective companies' graphing calculators, and even offer some features that would require external programs on a graphing calculator, like unit conversion.<br><br>
				If you need any of the above features, or your class requires them, read on. Some calculators may have links in their titles, meaning they have a dedicated page on MATHEMADNESS. It'd be a good idea to read them if you're interested in using them for more than just schoolwork.

				<h3>TI-73 Explorer</h3>
				<p>
					This calculator is designed for use in Grades 6-8, and is somewhat limited in functionality. Most models are a reskinned TI-83+, with an altered operating system and keypad layout. Some newer ones use the TI-84 Plus case instead. <br><br>
					It also has some alternative graph types like bar graphs and pie charts for more visual learning, as well as more kid-friendly simplification of fractions and unit conversion. <br><br>
					A lot of these features, minus the graphing, though, can also be found on the TI-30XS Multiview, TI-34 Multiview, and TI-36X Pro, so it fills a bit of a weird niche. It is cheaper than the TI-83 Plus, but usually not by enough to justify buying one.<br><br>
				</p>
				<h3><a href="../Z80/83.html">TI-83 Plus</a> and TI-84 Plus</h3>
				<p>
					These calculators are the most popular in TI's graphing calculator lineup, and, while basic, still plenty powerful for most people’s needs.<br><br>
					They’re very similar to a TI-30XS or TI-36X Pro in terms of user interface, but has improved statistics and table capabilities, as well as graphing, and a larger LCD display more suited to these tasks.<br><br>
					That display, though, is probably these calculator's greatest weaknesses. Viewing more detailed graphs is cloudy at best, requiring the use of the sluggish Zoom feature, and the ocasional on-screen directions are harder to read. It’s also very blurry when objects on screen are in motion, making some game genres less fun. Puzzle games, like Tetris, are more suited to the platform.<br><br>
					Between the two, there isn’t much difference. Just about all of the Apps and Games you could want will work on both, unless you run out of memory, which the 84 Plus does have more of. The most notable feature of the TI-84 Plus is MathPrint- it makes it so things like fractions, exponents and roots are displayed properly, similar to newer scientific calculators.<br><br>
				</p>
				<h3>TI-84 Plus CE</h3>
				<p>
					The new and improved version of the classic TI-84 Plus.<br><br>
					
					The main differences from the 84 Plus are the screen, thinness, speed, and battery. The thin build explains itself, so let’s talk about the others;<br><br>

					The calculator’s power source has been changed from AAA batteries to a rechargeable Li-Ion battery, which charges over miniUSB. It still lasts a decent amount of time, but still not as long as the black-and-white models. If you run out of juice during class, having the replacable batteries of the older models may be handy.<br><br>

					In exchange for this, you get a screen that’s backlit, almost 4 times the resolution, and in full color. The graphs and font are much easier on the eyes. It's also got a processor that, while still slow by today's standards, runs at over 3x the speed of the 84 Plus. It can also display pictures on the graphs through TI Connect, and has more storage. You can often find the CE for the same price as the regular TI-84 Plus.<br><br>
				</p>
				<a href="../68K/89.html"><h3>TI-89 Titanium</h3></a>
				<p>
					This is the most basic calculator TI sells with CAS. CAS allows more advanced work with variables. For more information, check out the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_algebra_system" target=none>Wikipedia article about it.</a> It can really help you through Algebra 2 and higher classes, if your teacher allows for it's use.<br><br>
					
					Aside from that, though, it has other noticeable improvements from the 84 series, like 3D graphing, split screen, more storage, and a much faster Motorola 68k processor. As you can imagine, it graphs pretty quickly, sometimes beating the 84+CE.<br><br>

					The screen isn’t backlit, but is still sharper than the 84’s. This is a pretty reasonable compromise, as it allows for better readability while maintaining long battery life. Due to the CAS, however, it isn’t allowed on either the ACT or IB exams.
				</p>
				<h3>TI Nspire CX-II and CX-II CAS</h3>
				<p>
					The Nspire series is TI’s most premium calculator lineup, the Mac Pro of TI, if you will. It has a completely different document based interface, a much more powerful ARM processor, a whopping 90MB of storage, as well as CAS and NON-CAS variants.<br><br>

					Like the 89-Titanium, the CAS version is not allowed on ACT and IB exams, but we'd reccomend it anyway, since you can disable it on this model with an Exam Mode. A good number of common commands you wouldn’t think require CAS, somehow do.<br><br>

					The somewhat confusing UI is probably the Nspire’s biggest weakness, but it's thankfully one that goes away with time. It's driven by a touchpad similar to a laptop, but smaller and a bit more tricky to maneuver. You can tell it was made with more advanced use cases in mind, like the TI-Innovator Hub.<br><br>

					As a neat bonus, though, since the Nspire is powered by a speedy ARM processor, similar in architecture to a smartphone, it can handle very impressive programs using the Ndless jailbreak! You can write your own programs in C++ on a desktop computer, or find amazing ports of games like Doom.<br><br>

					It also has the same battery and screen as the TI-84 Plus CE. The battery is decent, and the screen is plenty sharp.<br><br>
