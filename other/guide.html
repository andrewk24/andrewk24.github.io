			<h1> The MATHEMADNESS Guide to Choosing a Graphing Calculator <br>(Under construction)</h1>
			<p>
				There's a lot of graphing calculators to choose from today. It may be compelling to pick up a TI-84 Plus and be done with it, but if you're here, you must be interested in exploring other options. We'll be covering all the calculators the 4 major brands still sell and support, for the best longevity.<br><br>
				However, there's a couple questions you should ask yourself before reading on. Firstly, do you even need a graphing calculator?<br><br>
				Scientific and financial calculators have gotten considerably more advanced over the years, and the functionality gap between them with between every new model. So I present to you:<br>
				<h3>A List of Things That Most Scientific Calculators Cannot Do But Most Graphing Ones Can! (or LOTTMSCCDBMGOC for short)</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Graphing (of course)</li>
					<li>Running or creating games or programs</li>
					<li>Solving linear equations larger than degree three</li>
					<li>Transferring memory from one calculator to another</li>
					<li>Have it's OS updated</li>
				</ul>
				That might have been quite a bit less than you were expecting, considering modern graphing calculators are more or less pocket computers, so if you don't need the above features, consider purchasing a TI-36X Pro or Casio FX-991EX. These calculators are very close in terms of UI to their respective companies' graphing calculators, and even offer some features that would require external programs on a graphing calculator, like unit conversion.<br><br>
				If you need any of the above features, or your class requires them, read on.
