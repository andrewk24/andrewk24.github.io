			<h2> TI-80 </h2>
			<p> 
				The TI-80 was a cost-reduced version of the TI-81 for the middle-school market. Released in 1995, It cut down the screen size and was considerably slower, but still managed to retain a lot of a TI-81's identity. It was succeeded by the TI-73 series.<br><br>
				There isn't much to say other than this calculator, but it is exclusive in a few aspects. It's the only TI graphing calculator to use a Toshiba T6M53, and as such, there's no Assembly community for the TI-80. The only hardware improvement over the TI-81 was it's 7K of RAM over 2.4KB. It also lifted a few memory limits because of that increase in memory, like allowing up to 37 programs in TI-BASIC. The OS has support for fractions and some unit conversion. All of these features would come over to the TI-73 series.
