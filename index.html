	<h1> Welcome! </h1>
	<p> MATHEMADNESS is a site where we provide reviews, documentation, and resources to various graphing calculators. Usually, Texas Instruments, Casio, and HP are covered, but other noteworthy companies may be discussed as well. <br> The only requirement is that they can be programmed in some fashion! </p>

	<h3> TI-82 Advanced Python Edition Announced! • 4 March 2021 </h3>
	<p> Exciting times! TI just announced a cost-reduced TI-83 Premium CE (French equivalent to the 84+CE) on their <a href="https://education.ti.com/fr/produits/calculatrices/graphiques/ti-82-advanced-edition-python" target=none> french site!</a> It appears to be marketed as a cost-effective way to get into Python, and will be available in Fall of 2021. You can find a thread on Cemetech with more details
	<a href="https://www.cemetech.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=17485" target=none> here.</a> (Hope it comes to America soon!)</p>

	
	<h3> MATHEMADNESS YouTube Show! • 1 March 2021 </h3>
	<p> We've just created a new Youtube Channel to host new videos to aid the site. The first video is about the Texas Instruments 68k series of calculators.
	<a href="68K/68k-home.html"> Check it out! </a> </p>

	
	<h3> z80nline: a new Web-based 83/84+ simulator • 18 December 2020 </h3>
	<p> We here at MATHEMADNESS are starting a new project to make our site more interactive. A way to experience the TI-83 and 84 calculators for free, built from the ground up. <br>
	<a href="z80nline/index.html" target=none> You can find the testing page here to play with.</a> &nbsp;Eventually, this will be integrated into a Basic Tutoring section here!</p>
	
	
	<h3> <a href=https://yvantt.github.io/arTIfiCE/ target=none> arTIfiCE</a> opens up Asm support after TI lockout • 29 October 2020 </h3>
	<p> In TI's latest OS update for the 84 Plus CE and it's variants, support for unsigned programs written in eZ80 Assembly was removed. <br> <br>
	However, a jailbreak arose just a few months later known as arTIfiCE! The jailbreak works by using a flaw in TI's Cabri Jr. Flash App, which work similarly to Asm programs, and can install launchers like Cesium into the apps menu without being signed. Huzzah! <br>
	<a href=https://yvantt.github.io/arTIfiCE/ target=none> Visit arTIfiCE's website</a>  to find out how to install it for yourself. Happy programming!</p>
